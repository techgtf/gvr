    title:"Buying vs Renting in Noida Sector 107: Which Option is Right for You?",
    desc:"Noida Sector 107 has become a highly sought-after area for both buyers and renters, thanks to its strategic location, excellent connectivity, and well-developed infrastructure. If you're contemplating whether to buy or rent a property in this thriving locality, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of both options. Let's dive into the factors that can guide your decision.",
    subtitles:[
      {
        title: " Investment Potential and Property Appreciation",
        description: "Buying a property in Sector 107 offers significant long-term benefits, especially if you are looking to invest. The area has witnessed a steady rise in property prices, with the average rate ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹13,000 per sq. ft., depending on the project and its proximity to main roads. According to real estate experts, the region's price trend has been upward, with some areas witnessing growth rates of 5-7% annually​. For instance, luxury properties like a 3BHK flat in Mahagun Medalleo are priced at around ₹3.7 crore, equating to ₹21,600 per sq. ft., indicating a prime location's premium​. Buying a property now could lead to substantial capital gains in the future.",

        title: "Rental Demand and Affordable Option",
        description: "On the flip side, renting is a flexible option with low upfront costs and no long-term commitment. With an increasing number of families and working professionals moving to Noida, rental demand is strong, particularly in areas like Sector 107. Monthly rentals in the area range from ₹25,000 to ₹75,000 for 2BHK and 3BHK apartments​. Renting allows you to enjoy the amenities and lifestyle of Sector 107 without the hefty down payment or maintenance costs associated with ownership. For example, a 3BHK apartment in Mahagun Medalleo offers rental prices upwards of ₹75,000 per month​. If you're unsure about long-term stability or planning to move after a few years, renting can offer a greater degree of flexibility.",

      {
        title: "Flexibility vs. Stability",
        description: "Renting offers flexibility, especially if your work situation or personal life might change in the next few years. For example, people who are unsure about their long-term residency in Noida often prefer renting to avoid the hassle of selling a property later. Conversely, owning a property offers stability and a permanent base in a city that's continuously growing. Additionally, homeowners benefit from tax deductions on home loans, making buying a more financially rewarding option in the long run. Renters, however, do not enjoy this benefit​.",
